## Installing from PyPI

```
$ pip install pandas
```
If an error persists when using the "pip" command, check that your Python is up to date, or add ```--user``` to the end of the installation command.

## Installing with Miniconda

Make sure you have Conda downloaded first.

This command will create a new conda environment:

```
conda create -n name_of_my_env python
```
Put yourself in the environment by running:

```
source activate name_of_my_env
```

Finally, install pandas:

```
conda install pandas
```
